# Portfolio Website

A simple info site designed as a "business card" with Windows 95-style aesthetics. Built with **Astro** and styled entirely with pure CSS.

## Why I chose Astro?

I was curious to try out Astro after some good reviews. Astro is simple, well-performing, and modern JavaScript web framework for building static websites. I wanted to see if Astro can compete with old skool html, css and js. After testing Astro seemed like optimized and fast-loading with minimal need of JavaScript. End result was pretty lightweight, which I liked. But for small, minimalistic and static websites I would still prefer vanilla js, css and html to cut down the amount of files and possibly deprecating packages.

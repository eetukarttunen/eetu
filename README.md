# Portfolio Website

A simple info site designed as a "business card" with Windows 95-style aesthetics. Built with **Astro** and styled entirely with pure CSS.

## Why I chose Astro?

Astro was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and modern approach to building static websites. I wanted to try something now, rather than doing just plain html, css and js. Astro also enables optimized, fast-loading pages with minimal JavaScript, making it perfect for a lightweight, retro-themed website like this.
